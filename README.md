# Dockyard - Container And Artifact Repository 

![Dockyard](docs/images/dockyard.jpg "Dockyard - Container And Artifact Repository")

## What is Dockyard ?
Dockyard is a container and artifact repository storing and distributing container image, software artifact and virtual images of KVM or XEN. It's key features and goals include:
- Multi supported distribute protocols include Docker Registry V1 & V2 and App Container Image Discovery.
- Multi supported software artifact format include jar, war, tar and so on.
- Multi supported virtual images of KVM, XEN, VirtualBox and so on.
- Container image, software artifact and virtual images encryption, verification and vulnerability analytsis.
- Custome distribute protocol by framework base HTTPS and peer to peer. 
- Authentication in distributing process and authorization for public and private repository.
- Supporting mainstream object storage service like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage. 
- Built-in object storage service for deployment convenience.
- Web UI portal for all functions above.

## Why it matters ?

## The Dockyard's Story :)

## Runtime configuration

```
runmode = dev

listenmode = https
httpscertfile = cert/containerops/containerops.crt
httpskeyfile = cert/containerops/containerops.key

[log]
filepath = log/backend.log
level = info

[database]
driver = mysql
uri = containerops:containerops@/containerops?charset=utf8&parseTime=True&loc=Asia%2FShanghai

[deployment]
domains = containerops.me

[dockerv1]
standalone = true
version = 0.9
storage = /tmp/data/dockerv1

[dockerv2]
distribution = registry/2.0
storage = /tmp/data/dockerv2

[appc]
storage = /tmp/data/appc

[updateserver]
keymanager = /tmp/containerops_keymanager_cache
storage = /tmp/containerops_storage_cache

```

#### Nginx configuration
It's a Nginx config example. You can change **client_max_body_size** what limited upload file size. You should copy `containerops.me` keys from `cert/containerops.me` to `/etc/nginx`, then run **Dockyard** with `http` mode and listen on `127.0.0.1:9911`.

```nginx
upstream dockyard_upstream {
  server 127.0.0.1:9911;
}

server {
  listen 80;
  server_name containerops.me;
  rewrite  ^/(.*)$  https://containerops.me/$1  permanent;
}

server {
  listen 443;

  server_name containerops.me;

  access_log /var/log/nginx/containerops-me.log;
  error_log /var/log/nginx/containerops-me-errror.log;

  ssl on;
  ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/containerops.me.crt;
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/containerops.me.key;

  client_max_body_size 1024m;
  chunked_transfer_encoding on;

  proxy_redirect     off;
  proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
  proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
  proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
  proxy_set_header   Host $http_host;
  proxy_set_header   X-NginX-Proxy true;
  proxy_set_header   Connection "";
  proxy_http_version 1.1;

  location / {
    proxy_pass         http://dockyard_upstream;
  }
}
```

### Database Configuration

#### Database SQL

```
INSERT INTO mysql.user(Host,User,Password) VALUES ('localhost', 'containerops', password('containerops'));
CREATE DATABASE `containerops` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON containerops.* TO containerops@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'containerops';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

#### Initlization Tables

```
./dockyard db --action sync
```

### Start dockyard service
- Run directly:

```bash
./dockyard web --address 0.0.0.0
```

- Run with Nginx:

```bash
./dockyard web --address 127.0.0.1 --port 9911 &
```
